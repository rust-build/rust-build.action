# (Unofficial) Rust Release Binary Github Action

_Disclamer: this project has no affiliation with the official Rust project or trademark._

Automate publishing Rust build artifacts for GitHub releases through GitHub
Actions (Based on
[go-release.action](https://github.com/ngs/go-release.action))

For an example/template repo see
[rust-build.test](https://github.com/rust-build/rust-build.test)

This action will only work when you release a project as it uploads the
artifacts to the release.

## Environment variables

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN        # Must be set to ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} - Allows uploading of artifacts to release
RUSTTARGET          # The rust target triple, see README for supported triples
EXTRA_FILES         # Space separated list of extra files to include in final output
SRC_DIR             # Relative path to the src dir (directory with Cargo.toml in) from root of project
ARCHIVE_TYPES       # Type(s) of archive(s) to create, e.g. "zip" (default) or "zip tar.gz"; supports: (zip, tar.[gz|bz2|xz|zst])
ARCHIVE_NAME        # Full name of archive to upload (you must specify file extension and change this if building multiple targets)
PRE_BUILD           # Path to script to run before build e.g. "pre.sh"
POST_BUILD          # Path to script to run after build e.g. "post.sh"
MINIFY              # If set to "true", the resulting binary will be stripped and compressed by UPX. ("false" by default)
TOOLCHAIN_VERSION   # The rust toolchain version to use (see https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/toolchains.html#toolchain-specification)
EXTRA_COMMAND_FLAGS # Extra flags passed to `cargo build` command (e.g. `--features=...` to activate features)
UPLOAD_MODE         # What method to use to upload compiled binaries, supported values: (release, none), default: release
```

You can also use the `env` option to set any other argument variables for the build e.g. `RUSTFLAGS`.

## Examples

### Build windows and linux and upload as zip

```yml
# .github/workflows/release.yml

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  release:
    name: release ${{ matrix.target }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        target: [x86_64-pc-windows-gnu, x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Compile and release
        uses: rust-build/rust-build.action@v1.4.5
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          RUSTTARGET: ${{ matrix.target }}
          EXTRA_FILES: "README.md LICENSE"
```

### Build windows, linux and mac with native zip types

Will build native binaries for windows, linux and mac. Windows will upload as .zip, linux as .tar.gz, .tar.xz and
.tar.zst, and mac as .zip.

```yml
# .github/workflows/release.yml

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  release:
    name: release ${{ matrix.target }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
            archive: zip
          - target: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
            archive: tar.gz tar.xz tar.zst
          - target: x86_64-apple-darwin
            archive: zip
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Compile and release
        uses: rust-build/rust-build.action@v1.4.5
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          RUSTTARGET: ${{ matrix.target }}
          ARCHIVE_TYPES: ${{ matrix.archive }}
```

### Upload output as an artifact (or use with other steps)

```yml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
name: Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Compile
        id: compile
        uses: rust-build/rust-build.action@v1.4.5
        with:
          RUSTTARGET: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
          UPLOAD_MODE: none
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: Binary
          path: |
            ${{ steps.compile.outputs.BUILT_ARCHIVE }}
            ${{ steps.compile.outputs.BUILT_CHECKSUM }}
```

_Many target triples do not work, see #4_

## Supported targets

- `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
- `wasm32-wasi`
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`

## Static linking

Some libraries (like openssl, see #49, #66, #79) don't statically link
correctly on alpine. If you experience issues you can try disabling static
linking with

```yml
      - name: Compile
        id: compile
        uses: rust-build/rust-build.action@v1.4.5
        with:
          RUSTTARGET: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
          STATIC_LINKING: false
```
